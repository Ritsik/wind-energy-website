        <h2>About Wind Energy</h2>
        <p>Wind energy is a renewable source of energy that is generated by harnessing the power of the wind. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be used to generate electricity. The use of wind energy has numerous benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and providing sustainable energy for future generations.</p>
        <p>Wind energy systems can be installed onshore or offshore, with each type having its own advantages and challenges. Onshore wind farms are typically less expensive to install and maintain, while offshore wind farms can capture stronger and more consistent winds.</p>
        <p>Modern wind turbines come in various sizes and designs, suitable for different applications ranging from small residential installations to large-scale wind farms that power entire communities. The efficiency and capacity of wind turbines have improved significantly over the years, making wind energy a viable and competitive energy source.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What is wind energy?</h3>
            <p>Wind energy is the process of using the wind to generate electricity or mechanical power. Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy from the wind and convert it into usable energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do wind turbines work?</h3>
            <p>Wind turbines work by capturing the wind's kinetic energy with their blades. As the wind blows, it turns the blades, which are connected to a rotor. The rotor spins a generator, producing electricity.</p>
